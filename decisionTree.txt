# This file represents the hand-authored decision tree to be used by the bot playing Bomberman.
# The syntax of this file is as follows - 
# 	<nodeCode> <childCount>
# 	<firstChildCode> <childCount of firstChild>
# 	<firstGrandChild> <childCount of firstGrandChild>
# 	...
# 	<secondChild> <childCount of secondChild>
# 	...
#
# The codes are - 
# 	 EVAL_SIGNAL_STR_VARY = 1					(Does signal strength vary across adjacent tiles?)
# 	 EVAL_NEXT_TILE_OBSTACLE = 2				(Is next tile an obstacle?)
# 	 EVAL_NEXT_TILE_EMPTY = 3					(Is next tile empty?)
# 	 EVAL_KEY_FOUND = 4							(Has the key been found?)
# 	 EVAL_NEXT_TILE_HAS_MAX_GE = 5				(Does the next tile have the maximum gain-to-effort ratio, amongst all adjacent tiles?)
# 	
# 	 ACT_PATH_FIND_AND_FOLLOW = 101				(Find path to target and follow that path)
# 	 ACT_MOVE_NEXT_TILE = 102					(Move to the next tile)
# 	 ACT_PICK_NEW_DIR = 103						(Pick a new direction, and rotate to it)
# 	 ACT_PLANT_AND_MOVE_UNEXPLORED = 104		(Plant bomb and move to an unexplored tile outside of the bomb's blast radius)
# 	 ACT_PLANT_AND_MOVE_NEW = 105				(Plant bomb, move out of bomb's blast radius, wait till bomb's detonation and move to newly empty tile)
